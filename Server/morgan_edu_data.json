    "content": "Department of Computer Science The Society for the Advancement of Computer Science The computer science club is informally known as SACS (The Society for the Advancement of Computer Science). It was founded in 1964 and managed by Ms. Cynthia Harvey. The primary participants were members who were enrolled in other majors (like Mathematics, and Business), but who assisted in teaching Computer Science courses at the time that the club was founded. In 1976, SACS became a student affiliate of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). On campus (and in our tax forms), we are recognized as Association for Computing Machinery-Morgan State University (ACM-MSU), but we retain the SACS name as a homage to our beginnings. The SACS name is also useful because it helps the alumni identify us for activities such as Homecoming. Ms. Harvey was the advisor from 1964 to 1999. Ms. Sheila Wiggins was the advisor from 1999 to 2011, and Dr. Schinnel Small assumed the position of advisor when Ms. Wiggins retired in 2011. Our most popular event is the alumni reception, which is hosted every year at Homecoming to connect with alumni. Last year we celebrated 50 years of existence! The goal of the club was to promote the Computer Science major, develop camaraderie among CS and other STEM majors and promote concepts in CS as part of everyday activities. Please join the group on Facebook: Please contact us via email: The current members of the executive board are as follows: President - Daniel Nnaji Vice President - Derrell Carter Treasurer - Brandon Bronson Secretary (Corresponding) - Elizabeth Owolabi Secretary (Recording) - Adeoye Owolabi Webmaster - Schuyler Clark Our primary goals (other than increasing membership!) are to: 1) Assist with tutoring in Computer Science courses 2) Develop activities that utilize CS concepts (e.g. apps) 3) Community outreach (we have partnered with V-Linc for volunteer activities in the past.

    "content": "Department of Computer Science Degrees & Programs Offerings The department of Computer Science offers: The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science The undergraduate program in Computer Science prepares students for entry into the computing profession, for graduate study in computer, computational, and data sciences, and for the many challenges that will confront them in their professional and personal life. The Computer Science program also prepares students to apply their knowledge and training to produce solutions to specific and esoteric problems. Students learn to define the problem clearly; to determine its tractability; to determine when consultation with outside experts is appropriate; to evaluate and choose an appropriate solution strategy; and then to study, specify, design, implement, test, modify, and document that solution; to evaluate alternatives and perform risk analysis on that design; to integrate alternative techniques and technologies into that solution; and finally to communicate that solution to colleagues, to professionals in other fields, and to the general public. Key to all of this is the ability of the problem-solver to work within a team environment throughout the entire problem-solving process. . The Master of Science (M.S.) in Advanced Computing (Online/Onsite) The MS in Advanced Computing program preserves the core of Computer Science (CS) while possessing unique strength in emerging interdisaplinary areas in Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Cloud Computing. The program is delivered in both online and face-to-face formats. For online learning participates, students take ten courses and can complete the degree program in a 12-month period. Students can also choose to work on a project or conduct research and then write a thesis under the guidance of the CS faculty. . The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Advanced and Equitable Computing The Ph.D. program covers emerging areas of Computer Science including (but not limited to) Quantum Cryptography, Algorithms, Computing, Cybersecurity, AI/ML, Data Analytics, and challenges, resolutions and innovations in emotional, empathic, reliable, governable, traceable, resilient and responsible computing, and in the soon to be quantum age and the post-quantum age. The program can be taken on campus or fully remote/online. The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Cloud Computing (Online/Onsite) The BS in Cloud Computing instructional program is being offered online as well as in a traditional classroom setting (face-to-face), providing innovative, inclusive, hands-on, workforce-oriented, and distinctive educational experiences to a broad cross-section of the population, including adult learners and other nontraditional students.
