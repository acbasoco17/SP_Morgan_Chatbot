Department of Computer Science











The Computer Science Program provides students with fundamental computer science knowledge and training, and prepares them to apply their knowledge and training to produce solutions to specific problems. Students learn to define a problem clearly, determine its feasibility and choose an appropriate solution strategy. The solution strategy will study, specify, design, implement, test, modify, and document the solution. As part of the solution strategy, students will learn to evaluate alternative designs, perform risk analysis on alternative designs, and finally, communicate solutions to colleagues and other professionals. A key element to all of this is the ability of the student to work and collaborate within a team environment throughout the entire problem-solving process.
The Computer Science Curriculum has a set of core courses designed to accomplish two primary objectives:  

 provide practical knowledge that will be of immediate use in the profession; and
 provide a solid foundation in theoretical computer science, so that graduates will have the fundamentals necessary to acquire knowledge in a rapidly evolving discipline.

Bachelor of Computer Science degree students learning outcomes:

The Computer Science Program provides students with fundamental computer science knowledge and training, and prepares them to apply their knowledge and training to produce solutions to specific problems. Students learn to define a problem clearly, determine its feasibility and choose an appropriate solution strategy. The solution strategy will study, specify, design, implement, test, modify, and document the solution. As part of the solution strategy, students will learn to evaluate alternative designs, perform risk analysis on alternative designs, and finally, communicate solutions to colleagues and other professionals. A key element to all of this is the ability of the student to work and collaborate within a team environment throughout the entire problem-solving process.
The Computer Science Curriculum has a set of core courses designed to accomplish two primary objectives:  

 provide practical knowledge that will be of immediate use in the profession; and
 provide a solid foundation in theoretical computer science, so that graduates will have the fundamentals necessary to acquire knowledge in a rapidly evolving discipline.

Bachelor of Computer Science degree students learning outcomes:

Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program discipline.

"The Computer Science Program provides students with fundamental computer science knowledge and training, and prepares them to apply their knowledge and training to produce solutions to specific problems. Students learn to define a problem clearly, determine its feasibility and choose an appropriate solution strategy. The solution strategy will study, specify, design, implement, test, modify, and document the solution. As part of the solution strategy, students will learn to evaluate alternative designs, perform risk analysis on alternative designs, and finally, communicate solutions to colleagues and other professionals. A key element to all of this is the ability of the student to work and collaborate within a team environment throughout the entire problem-solving process.
The Computer Science Curriculum has a set of core courses designed to accomplish two primary objectives:  

 provide practical knowledge that will be of immediate use in the profession; and
 provide a solid foundation in theoretical computer science, so that graduates will have the fundamentals necessary to acquire knowledge in a rapidly evolving discipline.

Bachelor of Computer Science degree students learning outcomes:

Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program discipline.
Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.

For Master's and Ph.D. Programs, please visit the [Degrees & Programs] for Details.
We are dedicated to preparing students to be the next generation of scientists and professionals who will be able to compete effectively in the changing global society.
Areas of Learning Focus: Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Cryptography, Data Science, Game/Robotics, Quantum Computing, Cloud Computing.

Research Interests:
Computer Vision, Image Processing, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, and Data Mining and their application to retrieval for relevant and actionable information to achieving clinical and research goals in biomedicine. Dr. Rahman's research objectives may be formulated as seeking better ways to retrieve information from Biomedical images by moving beyond conventional text-based searching to combining both text and visual features in search queries. The approaches to meeting these objectives use a combination of techniques and tools from the above-mentioned fields.

Department of Nursing












Welcome to the Morgan State University, School of Community Health and Policy (SCHP), Department of Nursing. You are part of the special community formed here at Morgan State University, which has been designated by the state of Maryland as a Public Urban University. Within the MSU tradition, you will find respect for diversity of people and ideas, a common striving for excellence, and an unwavering dedication to service.
Within our nursing community faculty, staff, and students work together to create and sustain the best educational program. None of us can accomplish our educational vision and goals alone. You have a vital role:

Conscientiously studying
Acting honestly and with integrity
Respectfully questioning
Thoughtfully reflecting
Developing and refining critical thinking processes
Actively seeking assistance

You are part of an amazing institution that is rapidly rising in all aspects of its work, but keeps its sights clearly on excellence in education. We continue to innovate by incorporating evidence-based best practices into our programs. For example, we are expanding our undergraduate simulation labs to enhance student success and facilitate achievement of desired student outcomes. Keep alert! There are more good things to come.
We are delighted you are here and are excited about the prospect of continuing to prepare the next generations of nurses, at the bachelor's, master's and doctoral level. On behalf of the entire nursing faculty and staff, we look forward to working with you as you matriculate through the program, once you've successfully completed the program, and as an alumnus giving back to those entering the program after you.

Welcome to the Morgan State University, School of Community Health and Policy (SCHP), Department of Nursing. You are part of the special community formed here at Morgan State University, which has been designated by the state of Maryland as a Public Urban University. Within the MSU tradition, you will find respect for diversity of people and ideas, a common striving for excellence, and an unwavering dedication to service.
Within our nursing community faculty, staff, and students work together to create and sustain the best educational program. None of us can accomplish our educational vision and goals alone. You have a vital role:

Conscientiously studying
Acting honestly and with integrity
Respectfully questioning
Thoughtfully reflecting
Developing and refining critical thinking processes
Actively seeking assistance

You are part of an amazing institution that is rapidly rising in all aspects of its work, but keeps its sights clearly on excellence in education. We continue to innovate by incorporating evidence-based best practices into our programs. For example, we are expanding our undergraduate simulation labs to enhance student success and facilitate achievement of desired student outcomes. Keep alert! There are more good things to come.
We are delighted you are here and are excited about the prospect of continuing to prepare the next generations of nurses, at the bachelor's, master's and doctoral level. On behalf of the entire nursing faculty and staff, we look forward to working with you as you matriculate through the program, once you've successfully completed the program, and as an alumnus giving back to those entering the program after you.

Research Interests:
My approach to research is to actively engage students and interested faculty and practitioners in my research program. I call this “collaborative research, development and advancement”. My research program integrates teaching, scholarship and professional services with a focus on Networking and Cyber Security Science and Engineering. My main interests crosscut pervasive networking; cyber security, resilience and trust; nature-inspired computing and communications; and distributed cooperative computing.
The fabric of my research program is the continuum of interactive cyber-physical-social spaces that are intra- and inter-connected through an active computing and communications substrate (or active network) to provide smarter cyber-enabled services. The network under study must effectively and sustainably accommodate the diversity, dynamicity and varied scale of users, applications, resources, services, operating environments, and their complex interactions and behaviors. I consider next generation active networks as complex systems comprised of composable “simple” building blocks and associated distributed services and resources. Networks or network components are dynamically deployable, cognitive, autonomic, resilient and cooperative. In addition, as a complex system, the network design needs to consider not only the technological dimension, but also other dimensions such as the economic and social dimensions. Using such construction, my team of faculty, students and professionals explore computing and communications theory, and study, imagine, design and engineer network architectures and protocols that are evolvable, secure, resilient, efficient, scalable and sustainable.
My contributions to the body of knowledge, together with my students and colleagues, include: (1) Cooperative Autonomic Resilient Defense (CARD) platform; (2) Software behavior encryption for moving target defense; (3) Theory and system for SmartSENSE: Biologically-inspired Secure Elastic Networked Sensor Environment using our novel Cell-Oriented Architecture (COA) with intrinsic resilience and adaptability by construction, and employing Multi-criteria-based semantic routing for sensor-actuator networks; (3) Theory and algorithms for distributed dynamic combinatorial key management for ad hoc and sensor networks; (4) A reference architecture and system for trust and reputation management in ad hoc networks and P2P service networks; and (5) Cooperative mobile and vehicular cloud computing.

Research Interests:
My approach to research is to actively engage students and interested faculty and practitioners in my research program. I call this “collaborative research, development and advancement”. My research program integrates teaching, scholarship and professional services with a focus on Networking and Cyber Security Science and Engineering. My main interests crosscut pervasive networking; cyber security, resilience and trust; nature-inspired computing and communications; and distributed cooperative computing.
The fabric of my research program is the continuum of interactive cyber-physical-social spaces that are intra- and inter-connected through an active computing and communications substrate (or active network) to provide smarter cyber-enabled services. The network under study must effectively and sustainably accommodate the diversity, dynamicity and varied scale of users, applications, resources, services, operating environments, and their complex interactions and behaviors. I consider next generation active networks as complex systems comprised of composable “simple” building blocks and associated distributed services and resources. Networks or network components are dynamically deployable, cognitive, autonomic, resilient and cooperative. In addition, as a complex system, the network design needs to consider not only the technological dimension, but also other dimensions such as the economic and social dimensions. Using such construction, my team of faculty, students and professionals explore computing and communications theory, and study, imagine, design and engineer network architectures and protocols that are evolvable, secure, resilient, efficient, scalable and sustainable.
My contributions to the body of knowledge, together with my students and colleagues, include: (1) Cooperative Autonomic Resilient Defense (CARD) platform; (2) Software behavior encryption for moving target defense; (3) Theory and system for SmartSENSE: Biologically-inspired Secure Elastic Networked Sensor Environment using our novel Cell-Oriented Architecture (COA) with intrinsic resilience and adaptability by construction, and employing Multi-criteria-based semantic routing for sensor-actuator networks; (3) Theory and algorithms for distributed dynamic combinatorial key management for ad hoc and sensor networks; (4) A reference architecture and system for trust and reputation management in ad hoc networks and P2P service networks; and (5) Cooperative mobile and vehicular cloud computing.

My contributions to the body of knowledge, together with my students and colleagues, include: (1) Cooperative Autonomic Resilient Defense (CARD) platform; (2) Software behavior encryption for moving target defense; (3) Theory and system for SmartSENSE: Biologically-inspired Secure Elastic Networked Sensor Environment using our novel Cell-Oriented Architecture (COA) with intrinsic resilience and adaptability by construction, and employing Multi-criteria-based semantic routing for sensor-actuator networks; (3) Theory and algorithms for distributed dynamic combinatorial key management for ad hoc and sensor networks; (4) A reference architecture and system for trust and reputation management in ad hoc networks and P2P service networks; and (5) Cooperative mobile and vehicular cloud computing.

Research Interests:
Computer Vision, Image Processing, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, and Data Mining and their application to retrieval for relevant and actionable information to achieving clinical and research goals in biomedicine. Dr. Rahman's research objectives may be formulated as seeking better ways to retrieve information from Biomedical images by moving beyond conventional text-based searching to combining both text and visual features in search queries. The approaches to meeting these objectives use a combination of techniques and tools from the above-mentioned fields.

Research Interests:
Computer Vision, Image Processing, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, and Data Mining and their application to retrieval for relevant and actionable information to achieving clinical and research goals in biomedicine. Dr. Rahman's research objectives may be formulated as seeking better ways to retrieve information from Biomedical images by moving beyond conventional text-based searching to combining both text and visual features in search queries. The approaches to meeting these objectives use a combination of techniques and tools from the above-mentioned fields.

Research Interests:
Computer Vision, Image Processing, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, and Data Mining and their application to retrieval for relevant and actionable information to achieving clinical and research goals in biomedicine. Dr. Rahman's research objectives may be formulated as seeking better ways to retrieve information from Biomedical images by moving beyond conventional text-based searching to combining both text and visual features in search queries. The approaches to meeting these objectives use a combination of techniques and tools from the above-mentioned fields.

Middle States Accreditation FAQ











What is Middle States accreditation?
Middle States accreditation for Morgan State University involves demonstrating that the institution meets the rigorous standards set by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). This accreditation process thoroughly evaluates the university's mission, resources, and effectiveness in providing a high-quality education. Achieving accredited status validates Morgan State University's integrity and commitment to continuous improvement, fostering an environment dedicated to educational excellence and student success.







How long has Morgan been accredited by MSCHE?






Morgan State University has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since January 1, 1925. This long-standing accreditation underscores Morgan State's consistent commitment to maintaining high educational standards and continuous improvement in delivering quality education. The most recent reaffirmation of accreditation occurred in 2018, with the next reaffirmation process scheduled for April 2026.




Why is MSCHE accreditation important?






State and Federal Support: Accreditation has enabled Morgan State University to secure substantial state and federal support, including legislative appropriations and funding for research and development. This financial backing has been vital for the university's growth and sustainability. In summary, Morgan State University's accreditation has been instrumental in enhancing its academic reputation, ensuring financial stability, fostering institutional growth, and expanding its impact both locally and globally.




How does the MSCHE accreditation process work?






The MSCHE accreditation process for Morgan State University involves a rigorous, multi-step evaluation to ensure the institution meets the Commission’s standards of excellence. The process begins with the university conducting a detailed self-study, where it assesses its mission, resources, and effectiveness in delivering a quality education. This self-study is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators who visit the campus to verify the information and assess the institution's compliance with MSCHE standards. The peer review team then prepares a report, and Morgan State University can respond to the findings. Finally, the Commission reviews all the materials and makes an accreditation decision, confirming the institution's commitment to continuous improvement and educational excellence.




What is a MSCHE self-study report?






A Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) self-study report is a comprehensive document prepared by an institution undergoing the accreditation or reaccreditation process. This report serves as a reflective analysis of the institution's mission, goals, resources, and overall effectiveness in meeting MSCHE's standards of excellence. The self-study involves extensive internal review and data collection across various aspects of the institution, including governance, academic programs, student services, and financial stability. The report provides evidence of compliance with MSCHE standards and identifies areas for improvement, demonstrating the institution's commitment to continuous quality enhancement. Once completed, the self-study report is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators during a site visit, which plays a critical role in the accreditation decision.

Middle States Accreditation FAQ
"What is Middle States accreditation?

This accreditation process thoroughly evaluates the university's mission, resources, and effectiveness in providing a high-quality education. Achieving accredited status validates Morgan State University's integrity and commitment to continuous improvement, fostering an environment dedicated to educational excellence and student success.







How long has Morgan been accredited by MSCHE?






Morgan State University has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since January 1, 1925. This long-standing accreditation underscores Morgan State's consistent commitment to maintaining high educational standards and continuous improvement in delivering quality education. The most recent reaffirmation of accreditation occurred in 2018, with the next reaffirmation process scheduled for April 2026.




Why is MSCHE accreditation important?






State and Federal Support: Accreditation has enabled Morgan State University to secure substantial state and federal support, including legislative appropriations and funding for research and development. This financial backing has been vital for the university's growth and sustainability. In summary, Morgan State University's accreditation has been instrumental in enhancing its academic reputation, ensuring financial stability, fostering institutional growth, and expanding its impact both locally and globally.




How does the MSCHE accreditation process work?






The MSCHE accreditation process for Morgan State University involves a rigorous, multi-step evaluation to ensure the institution meets the Commission’s standards of excellence. The process begins with the university conducting a detailed self-study, where it assesses its mission, resources, and effectiveness in delivering a quality education. This self-study is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators who visit the campus to verify the information and assess the institution's compliance with MSCHE standards. The peer review team then prepares a report, and Morgan State University can respond to the findings. Finally, the Commission reviews all the materials and makes an accreditation decision, confirming the institution's commitment to continuous improvement and educational excellence.




What is a MSCHE self-study report?






A Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) self-study report is a comprehensive document prepared by an institution undergoing the accreditation or reaccreditation process. This report serves as a reflective analysis of the institution's mission, goals, resources, and overall effectiveness in meeting MSCHE's standards of excellence. The self-study involves extensive internal review and data collection across various aspects of the institution, including governance, academic programs, student services, and financial stability. The report provides evidence of compliance with MSCHE standards and identifies areas for improvement, demonstrating the institution's commitment to continuous quality enhancement. Once completed, the self-study report is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators during a site visit, which plays a critical role in the accreditation decision.

Center for Academic Success and Achievement











Mission
The Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA) is designed to promote better academic success among MSU students in terms of academic progress and retention. CASA has focused its energies around developing a structured operational and strategic plan to support the mission, vision, goals of the university. The Center provides a range of services whose goal is to reach students where they are and provide a bridge to where they want or need to be academically and socially. The Center's services include: the CASA Academy Program, the First-Year Student Program, the Resource/Tutoring Center, an advising unit for CASA Academy students and exploratory students (students with undeclared majors), and the development of a strengths-based education program. In the Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA), our highest priority is meeting the educational needs of our students. CASA represents a space where intellectual stimulation occurs and where students, faculty, and staff can meet to engage in dialogue/activities in a way that reciprocal learning occurs and one's knowledge is enhanced.




Vision
The Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA) strives to provide a welcoming, engaging and inclusive intellectual learning community where students gain knowledge of the fundamental study, social, and technological skills necessary for growth and academic success at Morgan State University. The Center strives to promote greater success through improvement in students' efforts, sense of purpose, scholarship, responsibility, accountability, personal pride and service to the greater community.







Morgan State University reserves the right to provide some or all instruction and related academic activities through alternative methods of delivery (other than face to face), including remote/online delivery. It also reserves the right to change the method of delivery before or during any academic term in the event of a health or safety emergency or other circumstance when it determines that such change is necessary or in the best interests of the campus community. Tuition and fees will not be reduced or refunded if the University changes the delivery method during any period or all of an academic session.

Mission
The Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA) is designed to promote better academic success among MSU students in terms of academic progress and retention. CASA has focused its energies around developing a structured operational and strategic plan to support the mission, vision, goals of the university. The Center provides a range of services whose goal is to reach students where they are and provide a bridge to where they want or need to be academically and socially. The Center's services include: the CASA Academy Program, the First-Year Student Program, the Resource/Tutoring Center, an advising unit for CASA Academy students and exploratory students (students with undeclared majors), and the development of a strengths-based education program. In the Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA), our highest priority is meeting the educational needs of our students. CASA represents a space where intellectual stimulation occurs and where students, faculty, and staff can meet to engage in dialogue/activities in a way that reciprocal learning occurs and one's knowledge is enhanced.




Vision
The Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA) strives to provide a welcoming, engaging and inclusive intellectual learning community where students gain knowledge of the fundamental study, social, and technological skills necessary for growth and academic success at Morgan State University. The Center strives to promote greater success through improvement in students' efforts, sense of purpose, scholarship, responsibility, accountability, personal pride and service to the greater community.







Morgan State University reserves the right to provide some or all instruction and related academic activities through alternative methods of delivery (other than face to face), including remote/online delivery. It also reserves the right to change the method of delivery before or during any academic term in the event of a health or safety emergency or other circumstance when it determines that such change is necessary or in the best interests of the campus community. Tuition and fees will not be reduced or refunded if the University changes the delivery method during any period or all of an academic session.

Center for Academic Success and Achievement











Mission
The Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA) is designed to promote better academic success among MSU students in terms of academic progress and retention. CASA has focused its energies around developing a structured operational and strategic plan to support the mission, vision, goals of the university. The Center provides a range of services whose goal is to reach students where they are and provide a bridge to where they want or need to be academically and socially. The Center's services include: the CASA Academy Program, the First-Year Student Program, the Resource/Tutoring Center, an advising unit for CASA Academy students and exploratory students (students with undeclared majors), and the development of a strengths-based education program. In the Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA), our highest priority is meeting the educational needs of our students. CASA represents a space where intellectual stimulation occurs and where students, faculty, and staff can meet to engage in dialogue/activities in a way that reciprocal learning occurs and one's knowledge is enhanced.




Vision
The Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA) strives to provide a welcoming, engaging and inclusive intellectual learning community where students gain knowledge of the fundamental study, social, and technological skills necessary for growth and academic success at Morgan State University. The Center strives to promote greater success through improvement in students' efforts, sense of purpose, scholarship, responsibility, accountability, personal pride and service to the greater community.







Morgan State University reserves the right to provide some or all instruction and related academic activities through alternative methods of delivery (other than face to face), including remote/online delivery. It also reserves the right to change the method of delivery before or during any academic term in the event of a health or safety emergency or other circumstance when it determines that such change is necessary or in the best interests of the campus community. Tuition and fees will not be reduced or refunded if the University changes the delivery method during any period or all of an academic session.

Mission
The Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA) is designed to promote better academic success among MSU students in terms of academic progress and retention. CASA has focused its energies around developing a structured operational and strategic plan to support the mission, vision, goals of the university. The Center provides a range of services whose goal is to reach students where they are and provide a bridge to where they want or need to be academically and socially. The Center's services include: the CASA Academy Program, the First-Year Student Program, the Resource/Tutoring Center, an advising unit for CASA Academy students and exploratory students (students with undeclared majors), and the development of a strengths-based education program. In the Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA), our highest priority is meeting the educational needs of our students. CASA represents a space where intellectual stimulation occurs and where students, faculty, and staff can meet to engage in dialogue/activities in a way that reciprocal learning occurs and one's knowledge is enhanced.




Vision
The Center for Academic Success and Achievement (CASA) strives to provide a welcoming, engaging and inclusive intellectual learning community where students gain knowledge of the fundamental study, social, and technological skills necessary for growth and academic success at Morgan State University. The Center strives to promote greater success through improvement in students' efforts, sense of purpose, scholarship, responsibility, accountability, personal pride and service to the greater community.







Morgan State University reserves the right to provide some or all instruction and related academic activities through alternative methods of delivery (other than face to face), including remote/online delivery. It also reserves the right to change the method of delivery before or during any academic term in the event of a health or safety emergency or other circumstance when it determines that such change is necessary or in the best interests of the campus community. Tuition and fees will not be reduced or refunded if the University changes the delivery method during any period or all of an academic session.

Research Interests:
My approach to research is to actively engage students and interested faculty and practitioners in my research program. I call this “collaborative research, development and advancement”. My research program integrates teaching, scholarship and professional services with a focus on Networking and Cyber Security Science and Engineering. My main interests crosscut pervasive networking; cyber security, resilience and trust; nature-inspired computing and communications; and distributed cooperative computing.
The fabric of my research program is the continuum of interactive cyber-physical-social spaces that are intra- and inter-connected through an active computing and communications substrate (or active network) to provide smarter cyber-enabled services. The network under study must effectively and sustainably accommodate the diversity, dynamicity and varied scale of users, applications, resources, services, operating environments, and their complex interactions and behaviors. I consider next generation active networks as complex systems comprised of composable “simple” building blocks and associated distributed services and resources. Networks or network components are dynamically deployable, cognitive, autonomic, resilient and cooperative. In addition, as a complex system, the network design needs to consider not only the technological dimension, but also other dimensions such as the economic and social dimensions. Using such construction, my team of faculty, students and professionals explore computing and communications theory, and study, imagine, design and engineer network architectures and protocols that are evolvable, secure, resilient, efficient, scalable and sustainable.
My contributions to the body of knowledge, together with my students and colleagues, include: (1) Cooperative Autonomic Resilient Defense (CARD) platform; (2) Software behavior encryption for moving target defense; (3) Theory and system for SmartSENSE: Biologically-inspired Secure Elastic Networked Sensor Environment using our novel Cell-Oriented Architecture (COA) with intrinsic resilience and adaptability by construction, and employing Multi-criteria-based semantic routing for sensor-actuator networks; (3) Theory and algorithms for distributed dynamic combinatorial key management for ad hoc and sensor networks; (4) A reference architecture and system for trust and reputation management in ad hoc networks and P2P service networks; and (5) Cooperative mobile and vehicular cloud computing.

Research Interests:
My approach to research is to actively engage students and interested faculty and practitioners in my research program. I call this “collaborative research, development and advancement”. My research program integrates teaching, scholarship and professional services with a focus on Networking and Cyber Security Science and Engineering. My main interests crosscut pervasive networking; cyber security, resilience and trust; nature-inspired computing and communications; and distributed cooperative computing.
The fabric of my research program is the continuum of interactive cyber-physical-social spaces that are intra- and inter-connected through an active computing and communications substrate (or active network) to provide smarter cyber-enabled services. The network under study must effectively and sustainably accommodate the diversity, dynamicity and varied scale of users, applications, resources, services, operating environments, and their complex interactions and behaviors. I consider next generation active networks as complex systems comprised of composable “simple” building blocks and associated distributed services and resources. Networks or network components are dynamically deployable, cognitive, autonomic, resilient and cooperative. In addition, as a complex system, the network design needs to consider not only the technological dimension, but also other dimensions such as the economic and social dimensions. Using such construction, my team of faculty, students and professionals explore computing and communications theory, and study, imagine, design and engineer network architectures and protocols that are evolvable, secure, resilient, efficient, scalable and sustainable.
My contributions to the body of knowledge, together with my students and colleagues, include: (1) Cooperative Autonomic Resilient Defense (CARD) platform; (2) Software behavior encryption for moving target defense; (3) Theory and system for SmartSENSE: Biologically-inspired Secure Elastic Networked Sensor Environment using our novel Cell-Oriented Architecture (COA) with intrinsic resilience and adaptability by construction, and employing Multi-criteria-based semantic routing for sensor-actuator networks; (3) Theory and algorithms for distributed dynamic combinatorial key management for ad hoc and sensor networks; (4) A reference architecture and system for trust and reputation management in ad hoc networks and P2P service networks; and (5) Cooperative mobile and vehicular cloud computing.

Research Interests:
My approach to research is to actively engage students and interested faculty and practitioners in my research program. I call this “collaborative research, development and advancement”. My research program integrates teaching, scholarship and professional services with a focus on Networking and Cyber Security Science and Engineering. My main interests crosscut pervasive networking; cyber security, resilience and trust; nature-inspired computing and communications; and distributed cooperative computing.
The fabric of my research program is the continuum of interactive cyber-physical-social spaces that are intra- and inter-connected through an active computing and communications substrate (or active network) to provide smarter cyber-enabled services. The network under study must effectively and sustainably accommodate the diversity, dynamicity and varied scale of users, applications, resources, services, operating environments, and their complex interactions and behaviors. I consider next generation active networks as complex systems comprised of composable “simple” building blocks and associated distributed services and resources. Networks or network components are dynamically deployable, cognitive, autonomic, resilient and cooperative. In addition, as a complex system, the network design needs to consider not only the technological dimension, but also other dimensions such as the economic and social dimensions. Using such construction, my team of faculty, students and professionals explore computing and communications theory, and study, imagine, design and engineer network architectures and protocols that are evolvable, secure, resilient, efficient, scalable and sustainable.
My contributions to the body of knowledge, together with my students and colleagues, include: (1) Cooperative Autonomic Resilient Defense (CARD) platform; (2) Software behavior encryption for moving target defense; (3) Theory and system for SmartSENSE: Biologically-inspired Secure Elastic Networked Sensor Environment using our novel Cell-Oriented Architecture (COA) with intrinsic resilience and adaptability by construction, and employing Multi-criteria-based semantic routing for sensor-actuator networks; (3) Theory and algorithms for distributed dynamic combinatorial key management for ad hoc and sensor networks; (4) A reference architecture and system for trust and reputation management in ad hoc networks and P2P service networks; and (5) Cooperative mobile and vehicular cloud computing.

Research Interests:
Computer Vision, Image Processing, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning, and Data Mining and their application to retrieval for relevant and actionable information to achieving clinical and research goals in biomedicine. Dr. Rahman's research objectives may be formulated as seeking better ways to retrieve information from Biomedical images by moving beyond conventional text-based searching to combining both text and visual features in search queries. The approaches to meeting these objectives use a combination of techniques and tools from the above-mentioned fields.

Middle States Accreditation FAQ











What is Middle States accreditation?
Middle States accreditation for Morgan State University involves demonstrating that the institution meets the rigorous standards set by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). This accreditation process thoroughly evaluates the university's mission, resources, and effectiveness in providing a high-quality education. Achieving accredited status validates Morgan State University's integrity and commitment to continuous improvement, fostering an environment dedicated to educational excellence and student success.







How long has Morgan been accredited by MSCHE?






Morgan State University has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since January 1, 1925. This long-standing accreditation underscores Morgan State's consistent commitment to maintaining high educational standards and continuous improvement in delivering quality education. The most recent reaffirmation of accreditation occurred in 2018, with the next reaffirmation process scheduled for April 2026.




Why is MSCHE accreditation important?






State and Federal Support: Accreditation has enabled Morgan State University to secure substantial state and federal support, including legislative appropriations and funding for research and development. This financial backing has been vital for the university's growth and sustainability. In summary, Morgan State University's accreditation has been instrumental in enhancing its academic reputation, ensuring financial stability, fostering institutional growth, and expanding its impact both locally and globally.




How does the MSCHE accreditation process work?






The MSCHE accreditation process for Morgan State University involves a rigorous, multi-step evaluation to ensure the institution meets the Commission’s standards of excellence. The process begins with the university conducting a detailed self-study, where it assesses its mission, resources, and effectiveness in delivering a quality education. This self-study is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators who visit the campus to verify the information and assess the institution's compliance with MSCHE standards. The peer review team then prepares a report, and Morgan State University can respond to the findings. Finally, the Commission reviews all the materials and makes an accreditation decision, confirming the institution's commitment to continuous improvement and educational excellence.




What is a MSCHE self-study report?






A Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) self-study report is a comprehensive document prepared by an institution undergoing the accreditation or reaccreditation process. This report serves as a reflective analysis of the institution's mission, goals, resources, and overall effectiveness in meeting MSCHE's standards of excellence. The self-study involves extensive internal review and data collection across various aspects of the institution, including governance, academic programs, student services, and financial stability.

"Middle States Accreditation FAQ











What is Middle States accreditation?
Middle States accreditation for Morgan State University involves demonstrating that the institution meets the rigorous standards set by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). This accreditation process thoroughly evaluates the university's mission, resources, and effectiveness in providing a high-quality education. Achieving accredited status validates Morgan State University's integrity and commitment to continuous improvement, fostering an environment dedicated to educational excellence and student success.







How long has Morgan been accredited by MSCHE?






Morgan State University has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since January 1, 1925. This long-standing accreditation underscores Morgan State's consistent commitment to maintaining high educational standards and continuous improvement in delivering quality education. The most recent reaffirmation of accreditation occurred in 2018, with the next reaffirmation process scheduled for April 2026.




Why is MSCHE accreditation important?






State and Federal Support: Accreditation has enabled Morgan State University to secure substantial state and federal support, including legislative appropriations and funding for research and development. This financial backing has been vital for the university's growth and sustainability. In summary, Morgan State University's accreditation has been instrumental in enhancing its academic reputation, ensuring financial stability, fostering institutional growth, and expanding its impact both locally and globally.




How does the MSCHE accreditation process work?






The MSCHE accreditation process for Morgan State University involves a rigorous, multi-step evaluation to ensure the institution meets the Commission’s standards of excellence. The process begins with the university conducting a detailed self-study, where it assesses its mission, resources, and effectiveness in delivering a quality education. This self-study is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators who visit the campus to verify the information and assess the institution's compliance with MSCHE standards. The peer review team then prepares a report, and Morgan State University can respond to the findings. Finally, the Commission reviews all the materials and makes an accreditation decision, confirming the institution's commitment to continuous improvement and educational excellence.




What is a MSCHE self-study report?






A Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) self-study report is a comprehensive document prepared by an institution undergoing the accreditation or reaccreditation process. This report serves as a reflective analysis of the institution's mission, goals, resources, and overall effectiveness in meeting MSCHE's standards of excellence. The self-study involves extensive internal review and data collection across various aspects of the institution, including governance, academic programs, student services, and financial stability. The report provides evidence of compliance with MSCHE standards and identifies areas for improvement, demonstrating the institution's commitment to continuous quality enhancement. Once completed, the self-study report is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators during a site visit, which plays a critical role in the accreditation decision.

Department of Nursing












Welcome to the Morgan State University, School of Community Health and Policy (SCHP), Department of Nursing. You are part of the special community formed here at Morgan State University, which has been designated by the state of Maryland as a Public Urban University. Within the MSU tradition, you will find respect for diversity of people and ideas, a common striving for excellence, and an unwavering dedication to service.
Within our nursing community faculty, staff, and students work together to create and sustain the best educational program. None of us can accomplish our educational vision and goals alone. You have a vital role:

Conscientiously studying
Acting honestly and with integrity
Respectfully questioning
Thoughtfully reflecting
Developing and refining critical thinking processes
Actively seeking assistance

You are part of an amazing institution that is rapidly rising in all aspects of its work, but keeps its sights clearly on excellence in education. We continue to innovate by incorporating evidence-based best practices into our programs. For example, we are expanding our undergraduate simulation labs to enhance student success and facilitate achievement of desired student outcomes. Keep alert! There are more good things to come.
We are delighted you are here and are excited about the prospect of continuing to prepare the next generations of nurses, at the bachelor's, master's and doctoral level. On behalf of the entire nursing faculty and staff, we look forward to working with you as you matriculate through the program, once you've successfully completed the program, and as an alumnus giving back to those entering the program after you.

Conscientiously studying
Acting honestly and with integrity
Respectfully questioning
Thoughtfully reflecting
Developing and refining critical thinking processes
Actively seeking assistance

You are part of an amazing institution that is rapidly rising in all aspects of its work, but keeps its sights clearly on excellence in education. We continue to innovate by incorporating evidence-based best practices into our programs. For example, we are expanding our undergraduate simulation labs to enhance student success and facilitate achievement of desired student outcomes. Keep alert! There are more good things to come.
We are delighted you are here and are excited about the prospect of continuing to prepare the next generations of nurses, at the bachelor's, master's and doctoral level. On behalf of the entire nursing faculty and staff, we look forward to working with you as you matriculate through the program, once you've successfully completed the program, and as an alumnus giving back to those entering the program after you.

The Office of Residence Life & Housing






University Managed Housing


We offer various housing options to all students who are interested in residing on campus. Self-guided virtual tours with descriptions of our residence halls can be found by clicking the hall names below. Each residence hall has a main area, vending machine, washers/dryers (at a cost), and in most residence halls, Academic Enrichment labs that are available for all student's respective academic needs. The main university dining facility is located in the new Thurgood Marshall Hall. 
Altus Apartments
Baldwin Hall
Blount Towers
Cummings Hall
Harper Tubman House
HH Midtown (Off-Campus)
Legacy Hall
Marble Hall Gardens Apartment Complex (Off-Campus)
Morgan View Apartments (Must apply for housing through Morgan View)
O'Connell Hall
Rawlings Hall
Thurgood Marshall Hall
Towson Town Place (Off-Campus)





Residence Hall Staff
Who can residents turn to for help? The live-in residential staff consists of Resident Director, Assistant Resident Directors, Resident Assistants and Desk Attendants. They are committed to the ideals and missions of both the University and The Office of Residence Life & Housing. These individuals are your primary contacts if you have problems or concerns.




Community Standards
Living in the halls can be rewarding and fun, however, it can also be a challenge. The Residence Hall Community Standards Handbook has been established, in conjunction with the Office of Judicial Affairs and Inter-Residence Council, as fundamental guidelines for group living. These standards seek to balance individual freedoms with rights of the community, to establish communities that recognize and celebrate the dignity and self worth of all community members, and to hold residents accountable when they choose to violate these standards.





Special Housing Needs
The Office of Residence Life & Housing is committed to meeting the needs of students who request special accommodations to the best of its ability under the ADA guidelines.
If you are a student requesting a reasonable accommodation related to housing because of a diagnosed disability, please contact the Office of Student Disability Support Services (SDSS) to register with their office at 443-885-1719, email them at SDSS@morgan.edu or  their website www.morgan.edu/SDSS.
Your request will be reviewed by SDSS in consultation with Health Services, the Counseling Center, and other appropriate college offices. The goal of this review is to provide an on-campus housing accommodation that best meets your need. SDSS will then make a recommendation to the Morgan State University Office of Residence Life & Housing regarding your request for special accommodation.
You are not guaranteed housing once registered with SDSS and must complete all necessary requirements of the Office of Residence Life & Housing. For priority consideration for the fall semester, applications must be completed by June 1st. Spring semester assignments are based on space availability.





Veterans of Military Service
The Office of Residence Life & Housing is committed to serving the housing needs of our student veterans. We recognize that veterans may enjoy a more mature setting than typical first-year housing. If you are considering residence hall housing and would like to be placed together with other veterans, transfer students, or non- first-year students, please email us at reslife@morgan.edu.




Housing Options and Assistance for LGBT Students
Our office is committed to you as a prospective student concerned about living on campus? In our community, there is a rightful place for all. If you are a prospective or current student who is transitioning and has special considerations regarding your on-campus housing? The Office of Residence Life & Housing responds to prospective and current student housing needs on a case-by-case basis. Our office is committed to establishing a community of respect and civil responsibility.





Work With Us!
ORLH at MSU is a dynamic program that attracts outstanding students and professionals. We offer a variety of student and professional staff positions that support the residential students at MSU and enhance the academic mission of the University. Professional positions, when available, will be posted on the University’s Human Resources website. We invite all enthusiastic and conscientious undergraduate and graduate students to express their interest in working for The Office of Residence Life & Housing at any time of the year.

University Managed Housing


We offer various housing options to all students who are interested in residing on campus. Self-guided virtual tours with descriptions of our residence halls can be found by clicking the hall names below. Each residence hall has a main area, vending machine, washers/dryers (at a cost), and in most residence halls, Academic Enrichment labs that are available for all student's respective academic needs. The main university dining facility is located in the new Thurgood Marshall Hall. 
Altus Apartments
Baldwin Hall

Legacy Hall
Marble Hall Gardens Apartment Complex (Off-Campus)
Morgan View Apartments (Must apply for housing through Morgan View)
O'Connell Hall
Rawlings Hall
Thurgood Marshall Hall
Towson Town Place (Off-Campus)





Residence Hall Staff
Who can residents turn to for help? The live-in residential staff consists of Resident Director, Assistant Resident Directors, Resident Assistants and Desk Attendants. They are committed to the ideals and missions of both the University and The Office of Residence Life & Housing. These individuals are your primary contacts if you have problems or concerns.




Community Standards
Living in the halls can be rewarding and fun, however, it can also be a challenge. The Residence Hall Community Standards Handbook has been established, in conjunction with the Office of Judicial Affairs and Inter-Residence Council, as fundamental guidelines for group living. These standards seek to balance individual freedoms with rights of the community, to establish communities that recognize and celebrate the dignity and self worth of all community members, and to hold residents accountable when they choose to violate these standards.





Special Housing Needs
The Office of Residence Life & Housing is committed to meeting the needs of students who request special accommodations to the best of its ability under the ADA guidelines.
If you are a student requesting a reasonable accommodation related to housing because of a diagnosed disability, please contact the Office of Student Disability Support Services (SDSS) to register with their office at 443-885-1719, email them at SDSS@morgan.edu or  their website www.morgan.edu/SDSS.
Your request will be reviewed by SDSS in consultation with Health Services, the Counseling Center, and other appropriate college offices. The goal of this review is to provide an on-campus housing accommodation that best meets your need. SDSS will then make a recommendation to the Morgan State University Office of Residence Life & Housing regarding your request for special accommodation.
You are not guaranteed housing once registered with SDSS and must complete all necessary requirements of the Office of Residence Life & Housing. For priority consideration for the fall semester, applications must be completed by June 1st. Spring semester assignments are based on space availability.





Veterans of Military Service
The Office of Residence Life & Housing is committed to serving the housing needs of our student veterans. We recognize that veterans may enjoy a more mature setting than typical first-year housing. If you are considering residence hall housing and would like to be placed together with other veterans, transfer students, or non- first-year students, please email us at reslife@morgan.edu.




Housing Options and Assistance for LGBT Students
Our office is committed to you as a prospective student concerned about living on campus? In our community, there is a rightful place for all. If you are a prospective or current student who is transitioning and has special considerations regarding your on-campus housing? The Office of Residence Life & Housing responds to prospective and current student housing needs on a case-by-case basis. Our office is committed to establishing a community of respect and civil responsibility.

Residence Hall Staff
Who can residents turn to for help? The live-in residential staff consists of Resident Director, Assistant Resident Directors, Resident Assistants and Desk Attendants. They are committed to the ideals and missions of both the University and The Office of Residence Life & Housing. These individuals are your primary contacts if you have problems or concerns.




Community Standards
Living in the halls can be rewarding and fun, however, it can also be a challenge. The Residence Hall Community Standards Handbook has been established, in conjunction with the Office of Judicial Affairs and Inter-Residence Council, as fundamental guidelines for group living. These standards seek to balance individual freedoms with rights of the community, to establish communities that recognize and celebrate the dignity and self worth of all community members, and to hold residents accountable when they choose to violate these standards.





Special Housing Needs
The Office of Residence Life & Housing is committed to meeting the needs of students who request special accommodations to the best of its ability under the ADA guidelines.
If you are a student requesting a reasonable accommodation related to housing because of a diagnosed disability, please contact the Office of Student Disability Support Services (SDSS) to register with their office at 443-885-1719, email them at SDSS@morgan.edu or  their website www.morgan.edu/SDSS.
Your request will be reviewed by SDSS in consultation with Health Services, the Counseling Center, and other appropriate college offices. The goal of this review is to provide an on-campus housing accommodation that best meets your need. SDSS will then make a recommendation to the Morgan State University Office of Residence Life & Housing regarding your request for special accommodation.
You are not guaranteed housing once registered with SDSS and must complete all necessary requirements of the Office of Residence Life & Housing. For priority consideration for the fall semester, applications must be completed by June 1st. Spring semester assignments are based on space availability.





Veterans of Military Service
The Office of Residence Life & Housing is committed to serving the housing needs of our student veterans. We recognize that veterans may enjoy a more mature setting than typical first-year housing. If you are considering residence hall housing and would like to be placed together with other veterans, transfer students, or non- first-year students, please email us at reslife@morgan.edu.

If you are a prospective or current student who is transitioning and has special considerations regarding your on-campus housing?

A Spring 2023 graduate, Jayla Pope, has the distinction of becoming the University’s latest Fulbright scholarship awarded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). To date, Morgan has received 67 U.S. Student Awards, allowing students  to study, teach or conduct research internationally in more than 25 countries. Pope is one of 329 Fulbright scholarships awarded to U.S. college students studying abroad for the upcoming academic year.
Pope, an alumna of Morgan’s Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management (SBM), earned a bachelor’s degree in Human Resource Management with a minor in Spanish and will continue her advanced degree studies abroad participating in the Fulbright Binational Business Program in Mexico City, Mexico. A native of South Bend, Ind., Pope will pursue graduate-level International Business courses at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México) and intern at a Mexican business.
“Jayla Pope exemplifies the academic excellence and global engagement we strive to instill and actively nurture in our students at the National Treasure. We want our students to prosper having a global perspective anchored in community sensibility and sensitivity,” said David K. Wilson, president of Morgan. “Her selection as a Fulbright Scholar is a testament to her dedication and the exceptional opportunities available at Morgan. We are confident she will continue to make significant contributions in her future endeavors.”
Fulbright represents one of many academic awards and distinctions Pope has accumulated during her matriculation at Morgan. In 2022, she was awarded the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, a highly competitive scholarship sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. The opportunity funded an immersive study abroad experience at the Universidad Del Mar (UMAR) in Oaxaca, Mexico, where Pope furthered her study in Spanish and sparked her interest in Mexico and Mexican culture.
“I think culturally (studying abroad) just made me way more aware, learning about cultural diversity, being in these types of spaces,” said Pope. “It has opened up doors for other opportunities. And so I’m very grateful for the experiences.”
During her undergraduate years, Pope also gained invaluable experience interning with various businesses and serving as an Immigrant Integration Specialist at Casa de Maryland through an AmeriCorps internship, assisting local Latine community members with tax filings. This summer, she is teaching ESOL (English as a Second Language) classes to non-native English speakers at Anne Arundel Community College (AACC). After her Fulbright year, she plans to pursue an MBA with a concentration in Human Resources, aspiring to work for an international company.
Megan DeVirgilis, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish and the newly appointed Fulbright Program Director at Morgan, added: “Jayla’s journey from her Gilman Scholarship experience to becoming a Fulbrighter highlights the transformative power of international education and dedicated language of study. Her commitment to her studies and community service is truly inspiring, and I look forward to seeing the impact she will have in the global business arena.”
Pope credits Morgan faculty and staff who have supported her journey toward attaining the Fulbright scholarship. Acknowledging Dr. DeVirgilis and Gonzalo Baptista, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish, for “writing letters of recommendation to prepping me for the Spanish interviews” and Moriah Ray, director of the Office of Study Abroad in the Division of International Affairs at Morgan, for helping to manifest the dream with unbridled encouragement.

“I really want to represent Morgan because it’s such a great school. Morgan has so many resources. And I’m very excited. I can’t wait to come back and try to recruit more people. Because Morgan has so much talent. We can have (many) more Fulbrighters. I’m 100% sure of that.”
The Fulbright Program aims to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries. Fulbright recipients are selected based on academic or professional achievement and demonstrated leadership potential. The Program operates in over 160 countries and supports various academic and professional opportunities abroad.
Morgan State University has a distinguished history with the Fulbright Program and was named a “Fulbright Top Producer” by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs for the fourth consecutive year. In addition to boasting 67 U.S. Student Awards which ranks among the top of all HBCUs, the University has received 30 Fulbright U.S. Scholar Awards, two Fulbright Specialist Awards, and eight Fulbright-Hays Awards. This summer, a Fulbright-Hays cohort from Morgan traveled to Bogota, Colombia, to participate in a group project entitled “Colombia: Youth Social, Political and Civic Engagement, Peace Building, and National Reconciliation.”
In recent months, Morgan faculty have been honored to receive Fulbright-related awards for their research and advanced study abroad. Yacob Astatke, D. Eng., assistant vice president for International Affairs, received a grant to participate in the Fulbright International Education Administrators (IEA) Program in France. Krishna Bista Ed.D., professor of Higher Education in the School of Education and Urban Studies’ (SEUS) Department of Advanced Studies, Leadership and Policy at Morgan, completed a two-week visit to the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) in Australia as a Fulbright Specialist. In May, Hakeem Ibikunle Tijani, Ph.D., executive director for the Office of Global Partnerships-Africa within the Division of International Affairs, was awarded the Fulbright Specialist Program to the Afro-American University of Central Africa (AAUCA) in Oyala, Equatorial Guinea for a yearlong fellowship.
In addition, Morgan has hosted Visiting Fulbright Scholars from Nigeria, Sudan, Morocco, and India, and will welcome another Scholar-in-Residence from Spain in the upcoming academic year. Under Dr. DeVirgilis’ leadership, Morgan has inaugurated an annual “Fulbright Week” each April to support and inform students and scholars about the application process.

Newly named Fulbright Scholar Adds to University’s Impressive Leadership Among HBCUs
 
BALTIMORE—Morgan State University, Maryland’s Preeminent Public Urban Research University, increased its status among HBCU leaders in producing highly-coveted Fulbright Scholarship awardees with the announcement of its 2024-2025 Fulbright U.S. Student Award. A Spring 2023 graduate, Jayla Pope, has the distinction of becoming the University’s latest Fulbright scholarship awarded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). To date, Morgan has received 67 U.S. Student Awards, allowing students  to study, teach or conduct research internationally in more than 25 countries. Pope is one of 329 Fulbright scholarships awarded to U.S. college students studying abroad for the upcoming academic year.
Pope, an alumna of Morgan’s Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management (SBM), earned a bachelor’s degree in Human Resource Management with a minor in Spanish and will continue her advanced degree studies abroad participating in the Fulbright Binational Business Program in Mexico City, Mexico. A native of South Bend, Ind., Pope will pursue graduate-level International Business courses at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México) and intern at a Mexican business.
“Jayla Pope exemplifies the academic excellence and global engagement we strive to instill and actively nurture in our students at the National Treasure. We want our students to prosper having a global perspective anchored in community sensibility and sensitivity,” said David K. Wilson, president of Morgan. “Her selection as a Fulbright Scholar is a testament to her dedication and the exceptional opportunities available at Morgan. We are confident she will continue to make significant contributions in her future endeavors.”
Fulbright represents one of many academic awards and distinctions Pope has accumulated during her matriculation at Morgan. In 2022, she was awarded the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, a highly competitive scholarship sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. The opportunity funded an immersive study abroad experience at the Universidad Del Mar (UMAR) in Oaxaca, Mexico, where Pope furthered her study in Spanish and sparked her interest in Mexico and Mexican culture.
“I think culturally (studying abroad) just made me way more aware, learning about cultural diversity, being in these types of spaces,” said Pope. “It has opened up doors for other opportunities. And so I’m very grateful for the experiences.”
During her undergraduate years, Pope also gained invaluable experience interning with various businesses and serving as an Immigrant Integration Specialist at Casa de Maryland through an AmeriCorps internship, assisting local Latine community members with tax filings. This summer, she is teaching ESOL (English as a Second Language) classes to non-native English speakers at Anne Arundel Community College (AACC). After her Fulbright year, she plans to pursue an MBA with a concentration in Human Resources, aspiring to work for an international company.
Megan DeVirgilis, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish and the newly appointed Fulbright Program Director at Morgan, added: “Jayla’s journey from her Gilman Scholarship experience to becoming a Fulbrighter highlights the transformative power of international education and dedicated language of study. Her commitment to her studies and community service is truly inspiring, and I look forward to seeing the impact she will have in the global business arena.”

"Newly named Fulbright Scholar Adds to University’s Impressive Leadership Among HBCUs
 
BALTIMORE—Morgan State University, Maryland’s Preeminent Public Urban Research University, increased its status among HBCU leaders in producing highly-coveted Fulbright Scholarship awardees with the announcement of its 2024-2025 Fulbright U.S. Student Award. A Spring 2023 graduate, Jayla Pope, has the distinction of becoming the University’s latest Fulbright scholarship awarded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). To date, Morgan has received 67 U.S. Student Awards, allowing students  to study, teach or conduct research internationally in more than 25 countries. Pope is one of 329 Fulbright scholarships awarded to U.S. college students studying abroad for the upcoming academic year.
Pope, an alumna of Morgan’s Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management (SBM), earned a bachelor’s degree in Human Resource Management with a minor in Spanish and will continue her advanced degree studies abroad participating in the Fulbright Binational Business Program in Mexico City, Mexico. A native of South Bend, Ind., Pope will pursue graduate-level International Business courses at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México) and intern at a Mexican business.
“Jayla Pope exemplifies the academic excellence and global engagement we strive to instill and actively nurture in our students at the National Treasure. We want our students to prosper having a global perspective anchored in community sensibility and sensitivity,” said David K. Wilson, president of Morgan. “Her selection as a Fulbright Scholar is a testament to her dedication and the exceptional opportunities available at Morgan. We are confident she will continue to make significant contributions in her future endeavors.”
Fulbright represents one of many academic awards and distinctions Pope has accumulated during her matriculation at Morgan. In 2022, she was awarded the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, a highly competitive scholarship sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. The opportunity funded an immersive study abroad experience at the Universidad Del Mar (UMAR) in Oaxaca, Mexico, where Pope furthered her study in Spanish and sparked her interest in Mexico and Mexican culture.
“I think culturally (studying abroad) just made me way more aware, learning about cultural diversity, being in these types of spaces,” said Pope. “It has opened up doors for other opportunities. And so I’m very grateful for the experiences.”
During her undergraduate years, Pope also gained invaluable experience interning with various businesses and serving as an Immigrant Integration Specialist at Casa de Maryland through an AmeriCorps internship, assisting local Latine community members with tax filings. This summer, she is teaching ESOL (English as a Second Language) classes to non-native English speakers at Anne Arundel Community College (AACC). After her Fulbright year, she plans to pursue an MBA with a concentration in Human Resources, aspiring to work for an international company.
Megan DeVirgilis, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish and the newly appointed Fulbright Program Director at Morgan, added: “Jayla’s journey from her Gilman Scholarship experience to becoming a Fulbrighter highlights the transformative power of international education and dedicated language of study. Her commitment to her studies and community service is truly inspiring, and I look forward to seeing the impact she will have in the global business arena.”
Pope credits Morgan faculty and staff who have supported her journey toward attaining the Fulbright scholarship. Acknowledging Dr. DeVirgilis and Gonzalo Baptista, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish, for “writing letters of recommendation to prepping me for the Spanish interviews” and Moriah Ray, director of the Office of Study Abroad in the Division of International Affairs at Morgan, for helping to manifest the dream with unbridled encouragement.

“I really want to represent Morgan because it’s such a great school. Morgan has so many resources. And I’m very excited. I can’t wait to come back and try to recruit more people. Because Morgan has so much talent. We can have (many) more Fulbrighters. I’m 100% sure of that.”
The Fulbright Program aims to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries. Fulbright recipients are selected based on academic or professional achievement and demonstrated leadership potential. The Program operates in over 160 countries and supports various academic and professional opportunities abroad.
Morgan State University has a distinguished history with the Fulbright Program and was named a “Fulbright Top Producer” by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs for the fourth consecutive year. In addition to boasting 67 U.S. Student Awards which ranks among the top of all HBCUs, the University has received 30 Fulbright U.S. Scholar Awards, two Fulbright Specialist Awards, and eight Fulbright-Hays Awards. This summer, a Fulbright-Hays cohort from Morgan traveled to Bogota, Colombia, to participate in a group project entitled “Colombia: Youth Social, Political and Civic Engagement, Peace Building, and National Reconciliation.”
In recent months, Morgan faculty have been honored to receive Fulbright-related awards for their research and advanced study abroad. Yacob Astatke, D. Eng., assistant vice president for International Affairs, received a grant to participate in the Fulbright International Education Administrators (IEA) Program in France. Krishna Bista Ed.D., professor of Higher Education in the School of Education and Urban Studies’ (SEUS) Department of Advanced Studies, Leadership and Policy at Morgan, completed a two-week visit to the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) in Australia as a Fulbright Specialist. In May, Hakeem Ibikunle Tijani, Ph.D., executive director for the Office of Global Partnerships-Africa within the Division of International Affairs, was awarded the Fulbright Specialist Program to the Afro-American University of Central Africa (AAUCA) in Oyala, Equatorial Guinea for a yearlong fellowship.
In addition, Morgan has hosted Visiting Fulbright Scholars from Nigeria, Sudan, Morocco, and India, and will welcome another Scholar-in-Residence from Spain in the upcoming academic year. Under Dr. DeVirgilis’ leadership, Morgan has inaugurated an annual “Fulbright Week” each April to support and inform students and scholars about the application process.

Middle States Accreditation FAQ











What is Middle States accreditation?
Middle States accreditation for Morgan State University involves demonstrating that the institution meets the rigorous standards set by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). This accreditation process thoroughly evaluates the university's mission, resources, and effectiveness in providing a high-quality education. Achieving accredited status validates Morgan State University's integrity and commitment to continuous improvement, fostering an environment dedicated to educational excellence and student success.







How long has Morgan been accredited by MSCHE?






Morgan State University has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since January 1, 1925. This long-standing accreditation underscores Morgan State's consistent commitment to maintaining high educational standards and continuous improvement in delivering quality education. The most recent reaffirmation of accreditation occurred in 2018, with the next reaffirmation process scheduled for April 2026.




Why is MSCHE accreditation important?






State and Federal Support: Accreditation has enabled Morgan State University to secure substantial state and federal support, including legislative appropriations and funding for research and development. This financial backing has been vital for the university's growth and sustainability. In summary, Morgan State University's accreditation has been instrumental in enhancing its academic reputation, ensuring financial stability, fostering institutional growth, and expanding its impact both locally and globally.




How does the MSCHE accreditation process work?






The MSCHE accreditation process for Morgan State University involves a rigorous, multi-step evaluation to ensure the institution meets the Commission’s standards of excellence. The process begins with the university conducting a detailed self-study, where it assesses its mission, resources, and effectiveness in delivering a quality education. This self-study is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators who visit the campus to verify the information and assess the institution's compliance with MSCHE standards. The peer review team then prepares a report, and Morgan State University can respond to the findings. Finally, the Commission reviews all the materials and makes an accreditation decision, confirming the institution's commitment to continuous improvement and educational excellence.




What is a MSCHE self-study report?






A Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) self-study report is a comprehensive document prepared by an institution undergoing the accreditation or reaccreditation process. This report serves as a reflective analysis of the institution's mission, goals, resources, and overall effectiveness in meeting MSCHE's standards of excellence. The self-study involves extensive internal review and data collection across various aspects of the institution, including governance, academic programs, student services, and financial stability. The report provides evidence of compliance with MSCHE standards and identifies areas for improvement, demonstrating the institution's commitment to continuous quality enhancement. Once completed, the self-study report is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators during a site visit, which plays a critical role in the accreditation decision.




Do I matter? What kind of input can I have?






As part of our ongoing accreditation process with the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), we value your input and insights. Your feedback is crucial in helping us understand our strengths and identify areas for improvement.

"Middle States Accreditation FAQ











What is Middle States accreditation?
Middle States accreditation for Morgan State University involves demonstrating that the institution meets the rigorous standards set by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). This accreditation process thoroughly evaluates the university's mission, resources, and effectiveness in providing a high-quality education. Achieving accredited status validates Morgan State University's integrity and commitment to continuous improvement, fostering an environment dedicated to educational excellence and student success.







How long has Morgan been accredited by MSCHE?






Morgan State University has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since January 1, 1925. This long-standing accreditation underscores Morgan State's consistent commitment to maintaining high educational standards and continuous improvement in delivering quality education. The most recent reaffirmation of accreditation occurred in 2018, with the next reaffirmation process scheduled for April 2026.




Why is MSCHE accreditation important?






State and Federal Support: Accreditation has enabled Morgan State University to secure substantial state and federal support, including legislative appropriations and funding for research and development. This financial backing has been vital for the university's growth and sustainability. In summary, Morgan State University's accreditation has been instrumental in enhancing its academic reputation, ensuring financial stability, fostering institutional growth, and expanding its impact both locally and globally.




How does the MSCHE accreditation process work?






The MSCHE accreditation process for Morgan State University involves a rigorous, multi-step evaluation to ensure the institution meets the Commission’s standards of excellence. The process begins with the university conducting a detailed self-study, where it assesses its mission, resources, and effectiveness in delivering a quality education. This self-study is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators who visit the campus to verify the information and assess the institution's compliance with MSCHE standards. The peer review team then prepares a report, and Morgan State University can respond to the findings. Finally, the Commission reviews all the materials and makes an accreditation decision, confirming the institution's commitment to continuous improvement and educational excellence.




What is a MSCHE self-study report?






A Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) self-study report is a comprehensive document prepared by an institution undergoing the accreditation or reaccreditation process. This report serves as a reflective analysis of the institution's mission, goals, resources, and overall effectiveness in meeting MSCHE's standards of excellence. The self-study involves extensive internal review and data collection across various aspects of the institution, including governance, academic programs, student services, and financial stability. The report provides evidence of compliance with MSCHE standards and identifies areas for improvement, demonstrating the institution's commitment to continuous quality enhancement. Once completed, the self-study report is reviewed by a team of peer evaluators during a site visit, which plays a critical role in the accreditation decision.

Alpha Sigma Lambda National Honor Society








HistoryIn 1945, Dr. Rollin B. Posey founded Alpha Sigma Lambda Honor Society to recognize and honor those dedicated adult students who, while adroitly handling their life responsibilities, achieve and maintain high scholastic standards.
MissionThe aim of Alpha Sigma Lambda is to acknowledge the special achievements of adults who accomplish academic excellence while facing competing responsibilities of home and work. For the adult learner in higher education, Alpha Sigma Lambda stands as an inspiration to scholastic growth and an invitation to associate with similarly motivated students.
Gamma Pi ChapterThe Morgan State University Gamma Pi Chapter of Alpha Sigma Lambda was chartered in 1984. After an eleven-year absence from the campus, it was reinstituted through CCPS in 2007.
                               To be eligible for membership into Alpha Sigma Lambda students must:

Be at least 24 years of age.
Hold a minimum of 24 graded credit hours earned at Morgan State University in an undergraduate degree program.
Have earned at least 12 credits in Liberal Arts/Science courses. If the student has not earned 12 Liberal Arts/Sciences credits within the 24 credits completed at Morgan State University, accepted transfer courses may be used to meet this requirement.
Have a minimum grade point average of 3.2 on a 4.0 scale.

Newly named Fulbright Scholar Adds to University’s Impressive Leadership Among HBCUs
 
BALTIMORE—Morgan State University, Maryland’s Preeminent Public Urban Research University, increased its status among HBCU leaders in producing highly-coveted Fulbright Scholarship awardees with the announcement of its 2024-2025 Fulbright U.S. Student Award. A Spring 2023 graduate, Jayla Pope, has the distinction of becoming the University’s latest Fulbright scholarship awarded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). To date, Morgan has received 67 U.S. Student Awards, allowing students  to study, teach or conduct research internationally in more than 25 countries. Pope is one of 329 Fulbright scholarships awarded to U.S. college students studying abroad for the upcoming academic year.
Pope, an alumna of Morgan’s Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management (SBM), earned a bachelor’s degree in Human Resource Management with a minor in Spanish and will continue her advanced degree studies abroad participating in the Fulbright Binational Business Program in Mexico City, Mexico. A native of South Bend, Ind., Pope will pursue graduate-level International Business courses at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México) and intern at a Mexican business.
“Jayla Pope exemplifies the academic excellence and global engagement we strive to instill and actively nurture in our students at the National Treasure. We want our students to prosper having a global perspective anchored in community sensibility and sensitivity,” said David K. Wilson, president of Morgan. “Her selection as a Fulbright Scholar is a testament to her dedication and the exceptional opportunities available at Morgan. We are confident she will continue to make significant contributions in her future endeavors.”
Fulbright represents one of many academic awards and distinctions Pope has accumulated during her matriculation at Morgan. In 2022, she was awarded the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, a highly competitive scholarship sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. The opportunity funded an immersive study abroad experience at the Universidad Del Mar (UMAR) in Oaxaca, Mexico, where Pope furthered her study in Spanish and sparked her interest in Mexico and Mexican culture.
“I think culturally (studying abroad) just made me way more aware, learning about cultural diversity, being in these types of spaces,” said Pope. “It has opened up doors for other opportunities. And so I’m very grateful for the experiences.”
During her undergraduate years, Pope also gained invaluable experience interning with various businesses and serving as an Immigrant Integration Specialist at Casa de Maryland through an AmeriCorps internship, assisting local Latine community members with tax filings. This summer, she is teaching ESOL (English as a Second Language) classes to non-native English speakers at Anne Arundel Community College (AACC). After her Fulbright year, she plans to pursue an MBA with a concentration in Human Resources, aspiring to work for an international company.
Megan DeVirgilis, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish and the newly appointed Fulbright Program Director at Morgan, added: “Jayla’s journey from her Gilman Scholarship experience to becoming a Fulbrighter highlights the transformative power of international education and dedicated language of study. Her commitment to her studies and community service is truly inspiring, and I look forward to seeing the impact she will have in the global business arena.”
Pope credits Morgan faculty and staff who have supported her journey toward attaining the Fulbright scholarship. Acknowledging Dr. DeVirgilis and Gonzalo Baptista, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish, for “writing letters of recommendation to prepping me for the Spanish interviews” and Moriah Ray, director of the Office of Study Abroad in the Division of International Affairs at Morgan, for helping to manifest the dream with unbridled encouragement.

“I really want to represent Morgan because it’s such a great school. Morgan has so many resources. And I’m very excited. I can’t wait to come back and try to recruit more people. Because Morgan has so much talent. We can have (many) more Fulbrighters. I’m 100% sure of that.”
The Fulbright Program aims to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries. Fulbright recipients are selected based on academic or professional achievement and demonstrated leadership potential. The Program operates in over 160 countries and supports various academic and professional opportunities abroad.
Morgan State University has a distinguished history with the Fulbright Program and was named a “Fulbright Top Producer” by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs for the fourth consecutive year. In addition to boasting 67 U.S. Student Awards which ranks among the top of all HBCUs, the University has received 30 Fulbright U.S. Scholar Awards, two Fulbright Specialist Awards, and eight Fulbright-Hays Awards. This summer, a Fulbright-Hays cohort from Morgan traveled to Bogota, Colombia, to participate in a group project entitled “Colombia: Youth Social, Political and Civic Engagement, Peace Building, and National Reconciliation.”
In recent months, Morgan faculty have been honored to receive Fulbright-related awards for their research and advanced study abroad. Yacob Astatke, D. Eng., assistant vice president for International Affairs, received a grant to participate in the Fulbright International Education Administrators (IEA) Program in France. Krishna Bista Ed.D., professor of Higher Education in the School of Education and Urban Studies’ (SEUS) Department of Advanced Studies, Leadership and Policy at Morgan, completed a two-week visit to the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) in Australia as a Fulbright Specialist. In May, Hakeem Ibikunle Tijani, Ph.D., executive director for the Office of Global Partnerships-Africa within the Division of International Affairs, was awarded the Fulbright Specialist Program to the Afro-American University of Central Africa (AAUCA) in Oyala, Equatorial Guinea for a yearlong fellowship.
In addition, Morgan has hosted Visiting Fulbright Scholars from Nigeria, Sudan, Morocco, and India, and will welcome another Scholar-in-Residence from Spain in the upcoming academic year. Under Dr. DeVirgilis’ leadership, Morgan has inaugurated an annual “Fulbright Week” each April to support and inform students and scholars about the application process.

Newly named Fulbright Scholar Adds to University’s Impressive Leadership Among HBCUs
 
BALTIMORE—Morgan State University, Maryland’s Preeminent Public Urban Research University, increased its status among HBCU leaders in producing highly-coveted Fulbright Scholarship awardees with the announcement of its 2024-2025 Fulbright U.S. Student Award. A Spring 2023 graduate, Jayla Pope, has the distinction of becoming the University’s latest Fulbright scholarship awarded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). To date, Morgan has received 67 U.S. Student Awards, allowing students  to study, teach or conduct research internationally in more than 25 countries. Pope is one of 329 Fulbright scholarships awarded to U.S. college students studying abroad for the upcoming academic year.
Pope, an alumna of Morgan’s Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management (SBM), earned a bachelor’s degree in Human Resource Management with a minor in Spanish and will continue her advanced degree studies abroad participating in the Fulbright Binational Business Program in Mexico City, Mexico. A native of South Bend, Ind., Pope will pursue graduate-level International Business courses at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México) and intern at a Mexican business.
“Jayla Pope exemplifies the academic excellence and global engagement we strive to instill and actively nurture in our students at the National Treasure. We want our students to prosper having a global perspective anchored in community sensibility and sensitivity,” said David K. Wilson, president of Morgan. “Her selection as a Fulbright Scholar is a testament to her dedication and the exceptional opportunities available at Morgan. We are confident she will continue to make significant contributions in her future endeavors.”
Fulbright represents one of many academic awards and distinctions Pope has accumulated during her matriculation at Morgan. In 2022, she was awarded the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, a highly competitive scholarship sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. The opportunity funded an immersive study abroad experience at the Universidad Del Mar (UMAR) in Oaxaca, Mexico, where Pope furthered her study in Spanish and sparked her interest in Mexico and Mexican culture.

Newly named Fulbright Scholar Adds to University’s Impressive Leadership Among HBCUs
 
BALTIMORE—Morgan State University, Maryland’s Preeminent Public Urban Research University, increased its status among HBCU leaders in producing highly-coveted Fulbright Scholarship awardees with the announcement of its 2024-2025 Fulbright U.S. Student Award. A Spring 2023 graduate, Jayla Pope, has the distinction of becoming the University’s latest Fulbright scholarship awarded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). To date, Morgan has received 67 U.S. Student Awards, allowing students  to study, teach or conduct research internationally in more than 25 countries. Pope is one of 329 Fulbright scholarships awarded to U.S. college students studying abroad for the upcoming academic year.
Pope, an alumna of Morgan’s Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management (SBM), earned a bachelor’s degree in Human Resource Management with a minor in Spanish and will continue her advanced degree studies abroad participating in the Fulbright Binational Business Program in Mexico City, Mexico. A native of South Bend, Ind., Pope will pursue graduate-level International Business courses at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México) and intern at a Mexican business.
“Jayla Pope exemplifies the academic excellence and global engagement we strive to instill and actively nurture in our students at the National Treasure. We want our students to prosper having a global perspective anchored in community sensibility and sensitivity,” said David K. Wilson, president of Morgan. “Her selection as a Fulbright Scholar is a testament to her dedication and the exceptional opportunities available at Morgan. We are confident she will continue to make significant contributions in her future endeavors.”
Fulbright represents one of many academic awards and distinctions Pope has accumulated during her matriculation at Morgan. In 2022, she was awarded the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, a highly competitive scholarship sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. The opportunity funded an immersive study abroad experience at the Universidad Del Mar (UMAR) in Oaxaca, Mexico, where Pope furthered her study in Spanish and sparked her interest in Mexico and Mexican culture.
“I think culturally (studying abroad) just made me way more aware, learning about cultural diversity, being in these types of spaces,” said Pope. “It has opened up doors for other opportunities. And so I’m very grateful for the experiences.”
During her undergraduate years, Pope also gained invaluable experience interning with various businesses and serving as an Immigrant Integration Specialist at Casa de Maryland through an AmeriCorps internship, assisting local Latine community members with tax filings. This summer, she is teaching ESOL (English as a Second Language) classes to non-native English speakers at Anne Arundel Community College (AACC). After her Fulbright year, she plans to pursue an MBA with a concentration in Human Resources, aspiring to work for an international company.
Megan DeVirgilis, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish and the newly appointed Fulbright Program Director at Morgan, added: “Jayla’s journey from her Gilman Scholarship experience to becoming a Fulbrighter highlights the transformative power of international education and dedicated language of study. Her commitment to her studies and community service is truly inspiring, and I look forward to seeing the impact she will have in the global business arena.”
Pope credits Morgan faculty and staff who have supported her journey toward attaining the Fulbright scholarship. Acknowledging Dr. DeVirgilis and Gonzalo Baptista, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish, for “writing letters of recommendation to prepping me for the Spanish interviews” and Moriah Ray, director of the Office of Study Abroad in the Division of International Affairs at Morgan, for helping to manifest the dream with unbridled encouragement.

“I really want to represent Morgan because it’s such a great school. Morgan has so many resources. And I’m very excited. I can’t wait to come back and try to recruit more people. Because Morgan has so much talent. We can have (many) more Fulbrighters. I’m 100% sure of that.”
The Fulbright Program aims to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries. Fulbright recipients are selected based on academic or professional achievement and demonstrated leadership potential. The Program operates in over 160 countries and supports various academic and professional opportunities abroad.
Morgan State University has a distinguished history with the Fulbright Program and was named a “Fulbright Top Producer” by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs for the fourth consecutive year. In addition to boasting 67 U.S. Student Awards which ranks among the top of all HBCUs, the University has received 30 Fulbright U.S. Scholar Awards, two Fulbright Specialist Awards, and eight Fulbright-Hays Awards. This summer, a Fulbright-Hays cohort from Morgan traveled to Bogota, Colombia, to participate in a group project entitled “Colombia: Youth Social, Political and Civic Engagement, Peace Building, and National Reconciliation.”
In recent months, Morgan faculty have been honored to receive Fulbright-related awards for their research and advanced study abroad. Yacob Astatke, D. Eng., assistant vice president for International Affairs, received a grant to participate in the Fulbright International Education Administrators (IEA) Program in France. Krishna Bista Ed.D., professor of Higher Education in the School of Education and Urban Studies’ (SEUS) Department of Advanced Studies, Leadership and Policy at Morgan, completed a two-week visit to the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) in Australia as a Fulbright Specialist.

BALTIMORE—Morgan State University, Maryland’s Preeminent Public Urban Research University, increased its status among HBCU leaders in producing highly-coveted Fulbright Scholarship awardees with the announcement of its 2024-2025 Fulbright U.S. Student Award. A Spring 2023 graduate, Jayla Pope, has the distinction of becoming the University’s latest Fulbright scholarship awarded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). To date, Morgan has received 67 U.S. Student Awards, allowing students  to study, teach or conduct research internationally in more than 25 countries. Pope is one of 329 Fulbright scholarships awarded to U.S. college students studying abroad for the upcoming academic year.
Pope, an alumna of Morgan’s Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management (SBM), earned a bachelor’s degree in Human Resource Management with a minor in Spanish and will continue her advanced degree studies abroad participating in the Fulbright Binational Business Program in Mexico City, Mexico. A native of South Bend, Ind., Pope will pursue graduate-level International Business courses at ITAM (Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México) and intern at a Mexican business.
“Jayla Pope exemplifies the academic excellence and global engagement we strive to instill and actively nurture in our students at the National Treasure. We want our students to prosper having a global perspective anchored in community sensibility and sensitivity,” said David K. Wilson, president of Morgan. “Her selection as a Fulbright Scholar is a testament to her dedication and the exceptional opportunities available at Morgan. We are confident she will continue to make significant contributions in her future endeavors.”
Fulbright represents one of many academic awards and distinctions Pope has accumulated during her matriculation at Morgan. In 2022, she was awarded the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, a highly competitive scholarship sponsored by the U.S. Department of State. The opportunity funded an immersive study abroad experience at the Universidad Del Mar (UMAR) in Oaxaca, Mexico, where Pope furthered her study in Spanish and sparked her interest in Mexico and Mexican culture.
“I think culturally (studying abroad) just made me way more aware, learning about cultural diversity, being in these types of spaces,” said Pope. “It has opened up doors for other opportunities. And so I’m very grateful for the experiences.”
During her undergraduate years, Pope also gained invaluable experience interning with various businesses and serving as an Immigrant Integration Specialist at Casa de Maryland through an AmeriCorps internship, assisting local Latine community members with tax filings. This summer, she is teaching ESOL (English as a Second Language) classes to non-native English speakers at Anne Arundel Community College (AACC). After her Fulbright year, she plans to pursue an MBA with a concentration in Human Resources, aspiring to work for an international company.
Megan DeVirgilis, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish and the newly appointed Fulbright Program Director at Morgan, added: “Jayla’s journey from her Gilman Scholarship experience to becoming a Fulbrighter highlights the transformative power of international education and dedicated language of study. Her commitment to her studies and community service is truly inspiring, and I look forward to seeing the impact she will have in the global business arena.”
Pope credits Morgan faculty and staff who have supported her journey toward attaining the Fulbright scholarship. Acknowledging Dr. DeVirgilis and Gonzalo Baptista, Ph.D., associate professor of Spanish, for “writing letters of recommendation to prepping me for the Spanish interviews” and Moriah Ray, director of the Office of Study Abroad in the Division of International Affairs at Morgan, for helping to manifest the dream with unbridled encouragement.

“I really want to represent Morgan because it’s such a great school. Morgan has so many resources. And I’m very excited. I can’t wait to come back and try to recruit more people. Because Morgan has so much talent. We can have (many) more Fulbrighters. I’m 100% sure of that.”
The Fulbright Program aims to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries. Fulbright recipients are selected based on academic or professional achievement and demonstrated leadership potential. The Program operates in over 160 countries and supports various academic and professional opportunities abroad.
Morgan State University has a distinguished history with the Fulbright Program and was named a “Fulbright Top Producer” by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs for the fourth consecutive year. In addition to boasting 67 U.S. Student Awards which ranks among the top of all HBCUs, the University has received 30 Fulbright U.S. Scholar Awards, two Fulbright Specialist Awards, and eight Fulbright-Hays Awards. This summer, a Fulbright-Hays cohort from Morgan traveled to Bogota, Colombia, to participate in a group project entitled “Colombia: Youth Social, Political and Civic Engagement, Peace Building, and National Reconciliation.”
In recent months, Morgan faculty have been honored to receive Fulbright-related awards for their research and advanced study abroad. Yacob Astatke, D. Eng., assistant vice president for International Affairs, received a grant to participate in the Fulbright International Education Administrators (IEA) Program in France. Krishna Bista Ed.D., professor of Higher Education in the School of Education and Urban Studies’ (SEUS) Department of Advanced Studies, Leadership and Policy at Morgan, completed a two-week visit to the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) in Australia as a Fulbright Specialist. In May, Hakeem Ibikunle Tijani, Ph.D., executive director for the Office of Global Partnerships-Africa within the Division of International Affairs, was awarded the Fulbright Specialist Program to the Afro-American University of Central Africa (AAUCA) in Oyala, Equatorial Guinea for a yearlong fellowship.
In addition, Morgan has hosted Visiting Fulbright Scholars from Nigeria, Sudan, Morocco, and India, and will welcome another Scholar-in-Residence from Spain in the upcoming academic year. Under Dr. DeVirgilis’ leadership, Morgan has inaugurated an annual “Fulbright Week” each April to support and inform students and scholars about the application process.

Division of International Affairs




Morgan Administrator Awarded Prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to Study Higher Education and Research in France, Spurring International Academic Exchange

Morgan State University’s Yacob Astatke, D. Eng., assistant vice president for International Affairs, was selected to receive a grant to participate in the Fulbright International Education Administrators (IEA) Program in France. The bilateral educational exchange initiative between the United States and France will afford Dr. Astatke a unique opportunity to study the French higher education and research systems. The program, which is financed by both governments and administered by the Franco-American Commission for Educational Exchange, serves as a way for the two countries to enhance their mutual understanding of each other through cooperation and collaboration among their students, teachers and research scholars. Dr. Astatke is one of 12 higher education professionals and executives selected to participate in the two-week program which takes place from October 7-19, 2023.
The international enrichment program brings together professionals and senior higher education officials by way of cross-cultural learning experiences designed to augment their institutions’ capacity for international education, cultivate international relationships, and support international educational exchange programs. Dr. Astatke will leverage his participation in the program to advance the implementation of the “Morgan Global” initiative — a key component to the University’s 10-year strategic plan, Transformation Morgan 2030, that focuses on accelerating global education initiatives and expanding the University’s international footprint. During his study in France, Dr. Astatke will establish relationships with French institutions of higher education developing bilateral agreements with colleges or universities that are interested in pursuing alliances with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Another goal will be to expand Virtual Exchange (VE) and Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) partnerships as well as study abroad opportunities for Morgan students. The time abroad will also include group seminars and workshops, campus visits, as well as meetings with selected government officials and French international education professionals.
According to the 2021 Open Doors Report, Black or African American students lag in the rate of participation in study abroad on a national level in comparison to other races and ethnicities. Morgan is among the nation’s top producers of Fulbright scholars and the first among HBCUs. To date, 149 students and 75 professors/administrators have received Fulbright-related grants and scholarships to teach and study abroad in more than 42 countries. This past fall for a third consecutive year, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs recognized Morgan as an HBCU Institutional Leader.
As the U.S. government’s flagship international exchange program for college students, faculty, and administrators, Fulbright has fostered mutual understanding and a rewarding flashpoint for cultural and educational exchange between the United States and other countries since its inception in 1946. Noted for its merit-based selection process and academic prestige, the program provides awards to approximately 8,000 students, scholars, teachers, artists, and professionals from the United States and other countries every year.
In his role as AVP of the Division of International Affairs, Dr. Astatke has led oversight and management of Morgan’s Office of Study Abroad and its Fulbright Scholarship Program. Recently, the Fulbright Scholarship Program, which is now housed within the University’s College of Liberal Arts, named faculty member Megan DeVirgilis, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Spanish, to serve as the program’s new advisor.
Congratulations Dr. Astatke for receiving this distinct honor and representing the National Treasure abroad as the Fulbright International Education Administrators (IEA) awardee for the 2023 cohort!

Morgan Administrator Awarded Prestigious Fulbright Fellowship to Study Higher Education and Research in France, Spurring International Academic Exchange



by Morgan State U

Morgan State University’s Yacob Astatke, D. Eng., assistant vice president for International Affairs, was selected to receive a grant to participate in the Fulbright International Education Administrators (IEA) Program in France. The bilateral educational exchange initiative between the United States and France will afford Dr. Astatke a unique opportunity to study the French higher education and research systems. The program, which is financed by both governments and administered by the Franco-American Commission for Educational Exchange, serves as a way for the two countries to enhance their mutual understanding of each other through cooperation and collaboration among their students, teachers and research scholars. Dr. Astatke is one of 12 higher education professionals and executives selected to participate in the two-week program which takes place from October 7-19, 2023.
The international enrichment program brings together professionals and senior higher education officials by way of cross-cultural learning experiences designed to augment their institutions’ capacity for international education, cultivate international relationships, and support international educational exchange programs. Dr. Astatke will leverage his participation in the program to advance the implementation of the “Morgan Global” initiative — a key component to the University’s 10-year strategic plan, Transformation Morgan 2030, that focuses on accelerating global education initiatives and expanding the University’s international footprint. During his study in France, Dr. Astatke will establish relationships with French institutions of higher education developing bilateral agreements with colleges or universities that are interested in pursuing alliances with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Another goal will be to expand Virtual Exchange (VE) and Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) partnerships as well as study abroad opportunities for Morgan students. The time abroad will also include group seminars and workshops, campus visits, as well as meetings with selected government officials and French international education professionals.
According to the 2021 Open Doors Report, Black or African American students lag in the rate of participation in study abroad on a national level in comparison to other races and ethnicities. Morgan is among the nation’s top producers of Fulbright scholars and the first among HBCUs. To date, 149 students and 75 professors/administrators have received Fulbright-related grants and scholarships to teach and study abroad in more than 42 countries. This past fall for a third consecutive year, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs recognized Morgan as an HBCU Institutional Leader.
As the U.S. government’s flagship international exchange program for college students, faculty, and administrators, Fulbright has fostered mutual understanding and a rewarding flashpoint for cultural and educational exchange between the United States and other countries since its inception in 1946. Noted for its merit-based selection process and academic prestige, the program provides awards to approximately 8,000 students, scholars, teachers, artists, and professionals from the United States and other countries every year.
In his role as AVP of the Division of International Affairs, Dr. Astatke has led oversight and management of Morgan’s Office of Study Abroad and its Fulbright Scholarship Program. Recently, the Fulbright Scholarship Program, which is now housed within the University’s College of Liberal Arts, named faculty member Megan DeVirgilis, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Spanish, to serve as the program’s new advisor.
Congratulations Dr. Astatke for receiving this distinct honor and representing the National Treasure abroad as the Fulbright International Education Administrators (IEA) awardee for the 2023 cohort!

Dr. Astatke is one of 12 higher education professionals and executives selected to participate in the two-week program which takes place from October 7-19, 2023.
The international enrichment program brings together professionals and senior higher education officials by way of cross-cultural learning experiences designed to augment their institutions’ capacity for international education, cultivate international relationships, and support international educational exchange programs. Dr. Astatke will leverage his participation in the program to advance the implementation of the “Morgan Global” initiative — a key component to the University’s 10-year strategic plan, Transformation Morgan 2030, that focuses on accelerating global education initiatives and expanding the University’s international footprint. During his study in France, Dr. Astatke will establish relationships with French institutions of higher education developing bilateral agreements with colleges or universities that are interested in pursuing alliances with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Another goal will be to expand Virtual Exchange (VE) and Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) partnerships as well as study abroad opportunities for Morgan students. The time abroad will also include group seminars and workshops, campus visits, as well as meetings with selected government officials and French international education professionals.
According to the 2021 Open Doors Report, Black or African American students lag in the rate of participation in study abroad on a national level in comparison to other races and ethnicities. Morgan is among the nation’s top producers of Fulbright scholars and the first among HBCUs. To date, 149 students and 75 professors/administrators have received Fulbright-related grants and scholarships to teach and study abroad in more than 42 countries. This past fall for a third consecutive year, the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs recognized Morgan as an HBCU Institutional Leader.
As the U.S. government’s flagship international exchange program for college students, faculty, and administrators, Fulbright has fostered mutual understanding and a rewarding flashpoint for cultural and educational exchange between the United States and other countries since its inception in 1946. Noted for its merit-based selection process and academic prestige, the program provides awards to approximately 8,000 students, scholars, teachers, artists, and professionals from the United States and other countries every year.
In his role as AVP of the Division of International Affairs, Dr. Astatke has led oversight and management of Morgan’s Office of Study Abroad and its Fulbright Scholarship Program. Recently, the Fulbright Scholarship Program, which is now housed within the University’s College of Liberal Arts, named faculty member Megan DeVirgilis, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Spanish, to serve as the program’s new advisor.
Congratulations Dr. Astatke for receiving this distinct honor and representing the National Treasure abroad as the Fulbright International Education Administrators (IEA) awardee for the 2023 cohort!"

Morgan Professor Selected As Fulbright Specialist to Share Higher Ed Expertise with the University of Southern Queensland in Australia



by Morgan State U

Building upon its earned designation as a Fulbright Program ‘HBCU Institutional Leader,’ Morgan State University continues its preeminence as a top producer of student, staff and faculty Fulbright recipients. To-date, nearly 80 Morgan professors or administrators have received Fulbright-related grants to study in more than 40 countries around the world. Most recently, Krishna Bista Ed.D., professor of Higher Education in the School of Education and Urban Studies’ (SEUS) Department of Advanced Studies, Leadership and Policy at Morgan, completed a two-week visit to the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) in Australia as a Fulbright Specialist. 
For Morgan, Dr. Bista became the second non-student to have been awarded a Fulbright-related award this past academic year. Earlier this summer, Yacob Astatke, D.Eng., received a grant to participate in the Fulbright International Education Administrators Program in France.  
Each year, the Fulbright Program selects a little more than 400 U.S. citizens to share their professional knowledge with host institutions throughout world as Fulbright Specialists. Recipients of Fulbright Specialist awards are competitively selected based on academic and professional achievement, demonstrated leadership in their field, and their potential to foster long-term cooperation between institutions in the U.S. and abroad. Dr. Bista was chosen based on his exceptional expertise and significant contributions to the field of global student mobility and international education. 
As a Fulbright Specialist, Dr. Bista engaged in a collaborative project titled ""Crossing the Divide: A Transnational Education Collaboration"" with the University of Southern Queensland. During the visit to Australia, he participated in robust discussions, seminars, meetings, and collaborations that will likely foster enduring academic partnerships. While at UniSQ, Dr. Bista met with a host of university dignitaries, including Professor Glen Coleman, deputy vice-chancellor of academic affairs; Professor Ren Yi, pro-vice-chancellor (International); Professor Petrea Redmond, leader of digital pedagogies; and numerous other esteemed members from various departments. 
Furthermore, Dr. Bista leveraged the opportunity to explore ways in which Morgan and UniSQ could collaborate in future, particularly in the areas of institutional resources and shared research interest; joint supervision of theses and dissertations; participation in editorial roles for academic journals; collaborative publication projects with prestigious publishers; and organizing an international conference at UniSQ, co-hosted with Morgan State University. 
Since coming back from his educational experience abroad, Dr. Bista seeks to integrate the insights and collaborative strategies he garnered during his time at UniSQ, strengthening Morgan’s commitment to academic brilliance and global engagement. Dr. Bista’s dedication to advancing international education and research exemplifies the university's commitment to excellence and global engagement. 
Funded by way of annual appropriation authorized by the U.S. Congress to the U.S. Department of State, the Fulbright Program serves as the U.S. government’s flagship international educational exchange program. Participating governments and host institutions, corporations, and foundations around the world also provide direct and indirect support to the Program, which operates in over 160 countries worldwide. Since its establishment in 1946, the Fulbright Program has given more than 400,000 students, scholars, teachers, artists, and scientists the opportunity to study, teach and conduct research, exchange ideas and contribute to finding solutions to shared international concerns.

Morgan Professor Selected As Fulbright Specialist to Share Higher Ed Expertise with the University of Southern Queensland in Australia



by Morgan State U



            August 31, 2023
        



Share












Building upon its earned designation as a Fulbright Program ‘HBCU Institutional Leader,’ Morgan State University continues its preeminence as a top producer of student, staff and faculty Fulbright recipients. To-date, nearly 80 Morgan professors or administrators have received Fulbright-related grants to study in more than 40 countries around the world. Most recently, Krishna Bista Ed.D., professor of Higher Education in the School of Education and Urban Studies’ (SEUS) Department of Advanced Studies, Leadership and Policy at Morgan, completed a two-week visit to the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) in Australia as a Fulbright Specialist. 
For Morgan, Dr. Bista became the second non-student to have been awarded a Fulbright-related award this past academic year. Earlier this summer, Yacob Astatke, D.Eng., received a grant to participate in the Fulbright International Education Administrators Program in France.  
Each year, the Fulbright Program selects a little more than 400 U.S. citizens to share their professional knowledge with host institutions throughout world as Fulbright Specialists. Recipients of Fulbright Specialist awards are competitively selected based on academic and professional achievement, demonstrated leadership in their field, and their potential to foster long-term cooperation between institutions in the U.S. and abroad. Dr. Bista was chosen based on his exceptional expertise and significant contributions to the field of global student mobility and international education. 
As a Fulbright Specialist, Dr. Bista engaged in a collaborative project titled ""Crossing the Divide: A Transnational Education Collaboration"" with the University of Southern Queensland. During the visit to Australia, he participated in robust discussions, seminars, meetings, and collaborations that will likely foster enduring academic partnerships. While at UniSQ, Dr. Bista met with a host of university dignitaries, including Professor Glen Coleman, deputy vice-chancellor of academic affairs; Professor Ren Yi, pro-vice-chancellor (International); Professor Petrea Redmond, leader of digital pedagogies; and numerous other esteemed members from various departments. 
Furthermore, Dr. Bista leveraged the opportunity to explore ways in which Morgan and UniSQ could collaborate in future, particularly in the areas of institutional resources and shared research interest; joint supervision of theses and dissertations; participation in editorial roles for academic journals; collaborative publication projects with prestigious publishers; and organizing an international conference at UniSQ, co-hosted with Morgan State University. 
Since coming back from his educational experience abroad, Dr. Bista seeks to integrate the insights and collaborative strategies he garnered during his time at UniSQ, strengthening Morgan’s commitment to academic brilliance and global engagement. Dr. Bista’s dedication to advancing international education and research exemplifies the university's commitment to excellence and global engagement. 
Funded by way of annual appropriation authorized by the U.S. Congress to the U.S. Department of State, the Fulbright Program serves as the U.S. government’s flagship international educational exchange program. Participating governments and host institutions, corporations, and foundations around the world also provide direct and indirect support to the Program, which operates in over 160 countries worldwide. Since its establishment in 1946, the Fulbright Program has given more than 400,000 students, scholars, teachers, artists, and scientists the opportunity to study, teach and conduct research, exchange ideas and contribute to finding solutions to shared international concerns.

To-date, nearly 80 Morgan professors or administrators have received Fulbright-related grants to study in more than 40 countries around the world. Most recently, Krishna Bista Ed.D., professor of Higher Education in the School of Education and Urban Studies’ (SEUS) Department of Advanced Studies, Leadership and Policy at Morgan, completed a two-week visit to the University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ) in Australia as a Fulbright Specialist. 
For Morgan, Dr. Bista became the second non-student to have been awarded a Fulbright-related award this past academic year. Earlier this summer, Yacob Astatke, D.Eng., received a grant to participate in the Fulbright International Education Administrators Program in France.  
Each year, the Fulbright Program selects a little more than 400 U.S. citizens to share their professional knowledge with host institutions throughout world as Fulbright Specialists. Recipients of Fulbright Specialist awards are competitively selected based on academic and professional achievement, demonstrated leadership in their field, and their potential to foster long-term cooperation between institutions in the U.S. and abroad. Dr. Bista was chosen based on his exceptional expertise and significant contributions to the field of global student mobility and international education. 
As a Fulbright Specialist, Dr. Bista engaged in a collaborative project titled ""Crossing the Divide: A Transnational Education Collaboration"" with the University of Southern Queensland. During the visit to Australia, he participated in robust discussions, seminars, meetings, and collaborations that will likely foster enduring academic partnerships. While at UniSQ, Dr. Bista met with a host of university dignitaries, including Professor Glen Coleman, deputy vice-chancellor of academic affairs; Professor Ren Yi, pro-vice-chancellor (International); Professor Petrea Redmond, leader of digital pedagogies; and numerous other esteemed members from various departments. 
Furthermore, Dr. Bista leveraged the opportunity to explore ways in which Morgan and UniSQ could collaborate in future, particularly in the areas of institutional resources and shared research interest; joint supervision of theses and dissertations; participation in editorial roles for academic journals; collaborative publication projects with prestigious publishers; and organizing an international conference at UniSQ, co-hosted with Morgan State University. 
Since coming back from his educational experience abroad, Dr. Bista seeks to integrate the insights and collaborative strategies he garnered during his time at UniSQ, strengthening Morgan’s commitment to academic brilliance and global engagement. Dr. Bista’s dedication to advancing international education and research exemplifies the university's commitment to excellence and global engagement. 
Funded by way of annual appropriation authorized by the U.S. Congress to the U.S. Department of State, the Fulbright Program serves as the U.S. government’s flagship international educational exchange program. Participating governments and host institutions, corporations, and foundations around the world also provide direct and indirect support to the Program, which operates in over 160 countries worldwide. Since its establishment in 1946, the Fulbright Program has given more than 400,000 students, scholars, teachers, artists, and scientists the opportunity to study, teach and conduct research, exchange ideas and contribute to finding solutions to shared international concerns.
